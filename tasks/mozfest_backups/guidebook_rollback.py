#  TODO:
# Rollback (separate file + made to be executed locally): do a diff on what's actually on guidebook (redo a dump of everything) and last backup.
# Check if tracks, location, session are different.
# Do a intersection set with session IDs + diff
# Check what's new (new ids)
# Check what was removed (ids that are not in the backup)
# create different jsons with all changes (session updates, deletes and additions)
# do requests to guidebook

# Need a CLI for people to run the rollback!
